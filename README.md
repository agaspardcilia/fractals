# Fractals

I was bored and had a friend who knows of to do maths, so we made something that makes fractals.

## Usage

You need to pass the result directory as the first parameter and the resolution as the second!


## Special thanks

Thanks to Hiram Kavciyan, the guy mentioned above who knows math stuff.
